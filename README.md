# Investigating the Relationship Between Public Transit Access and Social Isolation

By Naomi Buell and Richie Rivera

## Introduction

Social isolation is a critical public health issue that has been linked to higher rates of overall mortality and the development of chronic conditions such as depression, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and cancer.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)[\[2\]](#_ftn2)[\[3\]](#_ftn3) One potential contributing factor to social isolation is limited access to public transportation, which has been identified as a significant barrier to social engagement, particularly for older adults living in rural areas or those with mobility challenges.[\[4\]](#_ftn4) This research examines whether the availability of public transportation influences social isolation levels. Understanding this relationship can inform policies that enhance transportation infrastructure to improve social connectivity and overall well-being.
